# Democracy Candidate
This project receives no support from PACs or parties.  Any candidate can be featured here by agreeing to a pro-democracy pledge.

## Democracy Pledge

This pledge may be revised periodically, but all pledges and candidate profiles will be linked to the version of the pledge that was in effect when the candidate agreed to it.

* I agree with the tenets expressed in the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights).
* I acknowledge and celebrate the diverse mosaic within my community and world, spanning skin tones, religions, cultures, gender identities, sexual orientations, and backgrounds.
* I believe in embracing the ideals of equality and justice in a tangible way.
* I pledge to champion the civil rights of my fellow Americans, with a heightened commitment to marginalized communities currently under attack.
* I recognize that a robust public education system serves as the cornerstone of a functioning democracy, and I pledge to make supporting and advocating for educators, including teachers and librarians, a priority.
* I agree that everyone, regardless of citizenship status, is entitled to due process and safety under the law.
* I recognize the danger of climate change and the role of humans in creating it, and advocate for changes that will slow and reverse the damage it has caused.
* I believe that access to clean water is a human right.
* I regard easy and equitable access to healthcare necessary to a functioning society.
* I resist the influences of fascist and authoritarian rule.
