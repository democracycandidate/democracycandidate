### Hello!

My name is Ashley Cook. My family and I moved to Roselle in 2020, and we look forward to being a part of this incredible community for the rest of our lives. I’m a stay at home mom to a 4th grader, and our 3 year old niece lives with us as well. My background is in Anthropology, the study of which has helped me to see the world and all the cultures therein as a cohesive whole with beautiful pockets of differences. I love seeing this represented in our community: hearing Polish, Ukrainian, Spanish, and a myriad of other languages as I explore our village is lovely. I am well-versed in research and sorting through data to make well-informed decisions. In completing my thesis, I spent months gathering and analyzing data in order to draw conclusions and create understanding. 
In my free time, I like to crochet and knit, listen to live music, work crossword puzzles, spend time with my family and friends, and of course read. My reading goal this year is 52 books, and I’ll read almost anything. My favorite genres lately have been magical realism, literary fiction, and nonfiction, with a cozy mystery here and there as a palate cleanser. I track my reading on [Storygraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/ashtivist), and I would love for you to add me there so we can compare notes on books. 

**What the Library Means to Me and Why I’m Running**
I love our village and want to give back and help strengthen it. I also am passionate about libraries and the many ways they help the community. I like to think that this passion is a part of my heritage: my grandmother helped to build and populate her local library in the 1940s, my uncle spent his career at the Library of Congress, and my favorite elder cousin was a librarian at a university in Kentucky. Local libraries have been such a helpmate to me throughout my life: in school, they gave me a quiet place and many resources to aid in my studies; as a frugal new homeowner, they gave me access to media like movies, as well as resources that helped me learn about home maintenance and repair; as a new mom, they gave me parenting resources, storytimes, and activities to engage and socialize both my child and myself; and as a mom with a kiddo exploring their burgeoning independence, they give me a sense of comfort knowing that when my child goes to the library they will be safe, educated, out of trouble, supported, and given ample opportunity to explore, as well as opportunities for myself to expand my skills, take classes, socialize, and access books, ebooks, and audiobooks for free. Because libraries have given me so much, I want to help our library be as strong and successful as possible.


### Priorities

The construction of our new library is of great interest to me, both for our community and myself personally, as I live very close to the new location. I know that this project is going to be a large expense, and I will help ensure that the investment our community is placing into the new library is used wisely with a vision that takes a long and happy future into account. In preparation for running to be on our library’s board, I’ve spoken with many members of our community and was surprised to hear claims that libraries are not important, or are a dying entity due to a lack of usage. I wholeheartedly disagree! I will work to bring awareness of all the amazing and helpful resources that our library offers. I see the immediate future of our library as a turning point for our community, and I would love to be a part of its shaping. Strong libraries build strong communities, and as a devoted member of our community I am dedicated to maintaining and strengthening the success of our library.
