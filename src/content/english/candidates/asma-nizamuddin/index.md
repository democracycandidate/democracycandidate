Asma is running for Bloomingdale Library Trustee.  The library has always been a part of her life and education. She graduated with a B.S. from the University of Illinois Chicago.  She values the library as the heart of any community which provides access to books, the internet, and tons of resources.  Her exceptional community service, budgeting, and organizational skills will be a wonderful asset to our Library.  Her priorities are:

* Increase community engagement by developing programs that inspire lifelong learning and connecting people to opportunities for personal and professional growth.   She would like to promote practical and educational sessions on, mental and physical health needs and services for all ages.   Professional development should not only include resume building but networking, career guidance. She would like to see more opportunity for the community to meet upcoming and established authors.

* Enhance accessibility so that library services can be expanded to meet the ever-changing needs of all residents whether they are under 24 months, students, young adults, working professionals, seniors or families.  She would like to promote civic services as well such as DMV and passport services. 

* Encouraging inclusivity so that the library remains a welcoming space that celebrates diversity of the community and serves as a resource for everyone.
