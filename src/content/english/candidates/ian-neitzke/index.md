about: "With two decades managing businesses of various sizes, I have come to appreciate the value of a strong education system that prepares our children for an ever-changing future. Our schools need to prepare our children socially, emotionally, and intellectually, to compete in a global economy. Period."

My children are the 4th generation of my family to live in Medinah, and the 2nd generation to attend Medinah Schools. When my wife and I were looking for a home, we knew District 11 would provide a solid foundation for our kids’ development, but it was during the Transwestern annexation battles in 2022 that I realized how easily Medinah could be overrun by special interests.

I am the only member of my family who works outside of education. My mother is a school nurse, my father retired from Loyola University Medical Center, and both of my siblings are teachers. My grandma was a secretary at Lake Park High School for 25 years. I am running to serve our children and our community.

In addition to District 11 responsibilities, I represent The District on the board of the Northern Dupage Special Education Cooperative, a band of 8 school districts who pool resources for students with special needs. Beyond my “day job”, I also give time to entrepreneurs and college students in the food industry.
