about: "Three of my children graduated college with advanced degrees and  have amazing careers. I know what it takes to raise lifelong learners who are productive global citizens.  I also have a special needs child that had an IEP (Individualized Education Plan). My child attended college and trade school. The school staff worked very closely with me very early so that now my child is an independent productive global citizen."

**I want to serve on the Board of Education**

To execute the responsibilities of the school board by developing the annual budget to run the school system; setting school policies; and hiring and evaluating the superintendent.

If I do the above three items then the latter will follow; 

To do the maximum good for the most children in our district.

To assist the teachers, school staff and school board in fulfilling the school's mission and values.

I am a mother and grandmother who raised my children in Roselle. They attended Lake Park High School where I was a member of the Minority Task Force and worked very closely with school staff and administrators.

Three of my children graduated college with advanced degrees and  have amazing careers. I know what it takes to raise lifelong learners who are productive global citizens.  I also have a special needs child that had an IEP (Individualized Education Plan). My child attended college and trade school. The school staff worked very closely with me very early so that now my child is an independent productive global citizen. 

I want the children of Keeneyville School District 20 to get the best education possible. When they leave our district they won’t be taking a textbook or a brick from a building with them.  Maybe a laptop? They will be taking experiences, memories, most importantly skills and abilities which successfully prepared them for their next educational opportunity.

To inspire other community members to take an interest and step up to serve on the school board by hugely advertising and offering annual  trainings and open houses on how to be a school board member, to ensure a pipeline of interested candidates.

**My Education, Employment and Lived Experience will contribute to my board service.**

### Conclusion

One Christmas via Angle Tree with local churches, I secretly adopted every child in Hanover Park with an incarcerated parent and sent them Christmas presents on their parents behalf to remind them that they are loved and remembered.

I am willing to commit the necessary time to the task. 

During the pandemic, I started a virtual legal clinic. I am The Justice Champion of CTC Social Justice center, a virtual gospel justice center where 50% of our clients speak spanish. I recruited lawyers, neighbors and church members throughout DuPage County to volunteer and for the last four years. We have never missed serving clients.

For a couple of decades, I often went to Springfield, Illinois and Washington, DC with very powerful groups to meet with Members of Congress to ask for funding and for certain policies to be made into law.
