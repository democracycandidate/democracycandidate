At the time of writing this is verbatim the same pledge from [Defense of Democracy](https://defenseofdemocracy.org/pledge/).  This project has no affiliation with them, but saw no need to revise or change what they have already put forward.

> I acknowledge and celebrate the diverse mosaic within my community, spanning religions, cultures, gender identities, sexual orientations and backgrounds.

> I believe in embracing the ideals of equality and justice.

> I pledge to champion the civil rights of my fellow Americans, with a heightened commitment to marginalized communities currently under attack.

> I recognize that a robust public education system serves as the cornerstone of a functioning democracy.

> I pledge to make supporting and advocating for educators, including teachers and librarians a priority.

> I believe the role of educators is pivotal in cultivating an unbiased, informed, and engaged citizenry and is essential to the vitality of our democracy.

> I affirm the vital role of parental involvement in a childâ€™s education in the spirit of individual freedom and shared responsibility and partnership with educators.

> I acknowledge that decisions regarding classroom and library materials should be entrusted to qualified education professionals.
