## Help Voters Know About You

This project aims to help pro-democracy candidates in local elections establish a web presence. There is no cost to contributing a bio, and all parties are welcome here.  The only requirement is signing the pro-democracy pledge because this site is not a platform for jerks.

### Who Can Be Featured

This site is specifically for **local elections** where candidates often lack campaign website budgets, such as:

- School Board members
- Library Board trustees
- Park District commissioners
- Municipal trustees, officials, and councilmembers

We do **not** accept candidates for state legislative, statewide, or federal offices. Candidates running for higher offices typically have no trouble establishing a presence voters can easily find on search results.

### Getting Started

Ready to create a candidate profile? Here's the process:

1. **Ensure the candidate reviews and agrees to the [pro-democracy pledge](/running/pledge)**

3. **Contribute your candidate profile** using our [online form](/running/contribute) or via our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/democracycandidate/democracycandidate?tab=contributing-ov-file#readme)
