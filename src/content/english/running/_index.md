## Help Voters Know About You

This project aims to help pro-democracy candidates in local elections establish a web presence. There is no cost to contributing a bio, and all parties are welcome here.  The only requirement is signing the pro-democracy pledge because this site is not a platform for jerks.

### Who Can Be Featured

This site is specifically for **local elections** where candidates often lack campaign website budgets, such as:

- School Board members
- Library Board trustees
- Park District commissioners
- Municipal trustees, officials, and councilmembers

We do **not** accept candidates for state legislative, statewide, or federal offices. Candidates running for higher offices typically have no trouble establishing a presence voters can easily find on search results.

### Getting Started

Ready to create your profile? Here's what you need to do:

1. **Review and sign the [pro-democracy pledge](/running/pledge)**
2. **Prepare your candidate information** (bio, photo, positions, contact info)
3. **Submit your profile** via our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/democracycandidate/democracycandidate)
    * Please do not copy content from your other web presences.  This site is focused on providing good search results for interested voters.  Copying content can hurt the site's reputation and search engine optimization by making it appear to be an aggregator instead of a unique resource.
    * Be sure to read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/democracycandidate/democracycandidate/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

Questions? Check out our [About page](/about), view [current candidate profiles](/candidates) for examples, or open an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/democracycandidate/democracycandidate/issues) to ask questions.
