## Help Voters Know About You

This project aims to help pro-democracy candidates in local elections establish a web presence. There is no cost to contributing a bio, and all parties are welcome here.  The only requirement is signing the pro-democracy pledge because this site is not a platform for jerks.

### Who Can Be Featured

This site is specifically for **local elections** where candidates often lack campaign website budgets, such as:

- School Board members
- Library Board trustees
- Park District commissioners
- Municipal trustees, officials, and councilmembers

We do **not** accept candidates for state legislative, statewide, or federal offices. Candidates running for higher offices typically have no trouble establishing a presence voters can easily find on search results.

### Getting Started

Ready to create your profile? Here's what you need to do:

1. **Review and sign the [pro-democracy pledge](/running/pledge)**
2. **Prepare your candidate information** (bio, photo, positions, contact info)
3. **Submit your profile** via our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/democracycandidate/democracycandidate)

Questions? Check out our [About page](/about) or view [current candidate profiles](/candidates) for examples.
